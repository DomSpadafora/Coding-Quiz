#Coding Quiz

## Your Task

This assignment focused on creating a timed quiz. For the first time we are integrating Javascript into our web development skills. This quiz includes 4 questions on material I have learned in bootcamp. Scoring is defined on how much time is left when the last question has been answered. Each wrong answer deducts 10 seconds. Rankings for the top 5 scores are stored on the High Scores page. 

## User Story

```
